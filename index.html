				<p>
					Pastor Meg Morin came to the Brockport United Methodist Church in July, 2014, from Honeoye, NY after having served the Ionia UMC for eight years.
					<br>
					Prior to that she served as interim pastor at Silver Springs UMC, Warsaw Emmanuel and North Gainsville.
					<br>
					Prior to her entry into ministry, Pastor Meg was an adult educator for the State University of New York for educationally and economically disadvantaged adult students in Rochester, NY and a high school equivalency program developer in three school districts. Her teaching career spanned over 30 years.
					<br>
					Her appointment to the Brockport UMC brought her home to the village “of my heart”, she has said.  She came to SUNY Brockport in 1967 completing three degrees and served as a SUNY faculty member on the campus. Her daughter received her B.A. from Brockport and Pastor Meg loves to share that she was the advisor to her own daughter’s sorority on campus.
					<br>
					Pastor Meg has four adult children, four grandchildren in Greece and West Irondequoit.  She is also the guardian of a 16 year old Brockport high school student whom she says is keeping her perpetually young.
					<br>
					Asked what her very favorite thing to do is, her response is to be a loving and faithful representative for the church of Jesus Christ on the corner of Main and Erie!
