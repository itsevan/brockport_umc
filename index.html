					<p>
						Pastor Meg Morin came to the Brockport United Methodist Church in July, 2014, from Honeoye, NY after having served the Ionia UMC for eight years.
						<br>
						Prior to that she served as interim pastor at Silver Springs UMC, Warsaw Emmanuel and North Gainsville.
						<br>
						Prior to her entry into ministry, Pastor Meg was an adult educator for the State University of New York for educationally and economically disadvantaged adult students in Rochester, NY and a high school equivalency program developer in three school districts. Her teaching career spanned over 30 years.
						<br>
						Her appointment to the Brockport UMC brought her home to the village &quot;of my heart&quot;, she has said.  She came to SUNY Brockport in 1967 completing three degrees and served as a SUNY faculty member on the campus. Her daughter received her B.A. from Brockport and Pastor Meg loves to share that she was the advisor to her own daughter&apos;s sorority on campus.
						<br>
						Pastor Meg has four adult children, four grandchildren in Greece and West Irondequoit.  She is also the guardian of a 16 year old Brockport high school student whom she says is keeping her perpetually young.
						<br>
						Asked what her very favorite thing to do is, her response is to be a loving and faithful representative for the church of Jesus Christ on the corner of Main and Erie!
